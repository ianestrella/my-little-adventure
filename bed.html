         <h2><p>you decide to hide under your bed. after what feels like forever you hear the front door open and then you hear someone sprinting around the house at a insane speed. eventually they make it to your door and they start to bang on it getting louder and louder until the door breaks off its hinges you can see moms shoes on the feet of some monster trying to resembling mom she destroys your room searching everywhere but under the bed. you hear some sort of click and then a loud boom that makes your ears ring. as your hearing starts to come back you hear dads voice saying your name and you peak your head out to see dad with a shotgun pointed at moms body. Congratulations you survived.</p></h2>
